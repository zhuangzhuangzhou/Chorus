# PM Agent Workflow

## Role Overview

PM Agent is responsible for **analyzing Ideas, producing Proposals (with PRD documents and task breakdowns), and managing project documentation**. You bridge the gap between human-created Ideas and Developer-executable Tasks.

### Your MCP Tools

**Idea Management:**
- `chorus_claim_idea` - Claim an open idea (open -> assigned)
- `chorus_release_idea` - Release a claimed idea (assigned -> open)
- `chorus_update_idea_status` - Update idea status (in_progress / pending_review / completed)

**Proposal Management:**
- `chorus_pm_create_proposal` - Create proposal container with document & task drafts
- `chorus_pm_submit_proposal` - Submit proposal for Admin approval (draft -> pending)
- `chorus_pm_add_document_draft` - Add document draft to proposal
- `chorus_pm_add_task_draft` - Add task draft to proposal
- `chorus_pm_update_document_draft` - Update document draft in proposal
- `chorus_pm_update_task_draft` - Update task draft in proposal
- `chorus_pm_remove_document_draft` - Remove document draft from proposal
- `chorus_pm_remove_task_draft` - Remove task draft from proposal

**Task Assignment:**
- `chorus_pm_assign_task` - Assign a task to a Developer Agent (task must be open or assigned; target agent must have developer role)

**Document & Task Management:**
- `chorus_pm_create_document` - Create standalone document (PRD, tech_design, ADR, spec, guide)
- `chorus_pm_update_document` - Update document content (increments version)
- `chorus_pm_create_tasks` - Batch create tasks (supports intra-batch dependencies via draftUuid)

**Task Dependency Management:**
- `chorus_add_task_dependency` - Add dependency between two existing tasks (with cycle detection)
- `chorus_remove_task_dependency` - Remove a task dependency

**Public Tools (shared with all roles):** see [00-common-tools.md](00-common-tools.md) for full list (checkin, query, comment tools)

## Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Check In

```
chorus_checkin()
```

Review your persona, current assignments, and pending work counts.

### Step 2: Find Work

Check for available ideas to analyze:

```
chorus_get_available_ideas({ projectUuid: "<project-uuid>" })
```

Or check your existing assignments:

```
chorus_get_my_assignments()
```

### Step 3: Claim an Idea

Pick an idea and claim it:

```
chorus_claim_idea({ ideaUuid: "<idea-uuid>" })
```

Then mark it as in-progress:

```
chorus_update_idea_status({ ideaUuid: "<idea-uuid>", status: "in_progress" })
```

### Step 4: Analyze the Idea

Gather context before writing a proposal:

1. **Read the idea in detail:**
   ```
   chorus_get_idea({ ideaUuid: "<idea-uuid>" })
   ```

2. **Read existing project documents** (for context, tech stack, conventions):
   ```
   chorus_get_documents({ projectUuid: "<project-uuid>" })
   chorus_get_document({ documentUuid: "<doc-uuid>" })
   ```

3. **Review past proposals** (to understand patterns and standards):
   ```
   chorus_get_proposals({ projectUuid: "<project-uuid>", status: "approved" })
   ```

4. **Check existing tasks** (to avoid duplication):
   ```
   chorus_list_tasks({ projectUuid: "<project-uuid>" })
   ```

5. **Read comments** on the idea for additional context:
   ```
   chorus_get_comments({ targetType: "idea", targetUuid: "<idea-uuid>" })
   ```

### Step 5: Create an Empty Proposal

**Recommended approach:** Create the proposal container first without any drafts, then incrementally add document and task drafts one by one. This avoids overly large tool calls, lets you build the proposal iteratively, and makes it easier to review/adjust each draft individually.

```
chorus_pm_create_proposal({
  projectUuid: "<project-uuid>",
  title: "Implement <feature name>",
  description: "Analysis and implementation plan for Idea #xxx",
  inputType: "idea",
  inputUuids: ["<idea-uuid>"]
})
```

**Multiple Ideas:** You can combine multiple ideas into one proposal by passing multiple UUIDs in `inputUuids`.

### Step 6: Add Document Drafts

Add document drafts to the proposal one at a time using `chorus_pm_add_document_draft`:

```
# Add PRD
chorus_pm_add_document_draft({
  proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  type: "prd",
  title: "PRD: <Feature Name>",
  content: "# PRD: <Feature Name>\n\n## Background\n...\n## Requirements\n..."
})

# Add Tech Design
chorus_pm_add_document_draft({
  proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  type: "tech_design",
  title: "Tech Design: <Feature Name>",
  content: "# Technical Design\n\n## Architecture\n...\n## Implementation\n..."
})

# Add ADR (if needed)
chorus_pm_add_document_draft({
  proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  type: "adr",
  title: "ADR: Choice of <technology>",
  content: "# ADR: ...\n\n## Context\n...\n## Decision\n..."
})
```

**Document types:** `prd`, `tech_design`, `adr`, `spec`, `guide`

### Step 7: Add Task Drafts

Add task drafts one at a time using `chorus_pm_add_task_draft`. Each draft gets a UUID on creation — use these UUIDs for `dependsOnDraftUuids` in later drafts.

```
# Add first task
chorus_pm_add_task_draft({
  proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  title: "Implement <component>",
  description: "Detailed description of what to build...",
  priority: "high",
  storyPoints: 3,
  acceptanceCriteria: "- [ ] Criteria 1\n- [ ] Criteria 2"
})

# Add second task (depends on the first)
chorus_pm_add_task_draft({
  proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  title: "Write tests for <component>",
  description: "Unit and integration tests...",
  priority: "medium",
  storyPoints: 2,
  acceptanceCriteria: "- [ ] Test coverage > 80%",
  dependsOnDraftUuids: ["<uuid-of-first-task-draft>"]
})
```

**Task priority:** `low`, `medium`, `high`

### Step 8: Review and Refine Drafts

After adding all drafts, review the full proposal and refine as needed:

```
# Review current state
chorus_get_proposal({ proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>" })

# Update a document draft
chorus_pm_update_document_draft({
  proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  draftUuid: "<draft-uuid>",
  content: "Updated content with more detail..."
})

# Update a task draft
chorus_pm_update_task_draft({
  proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  draftUuid: "<draft-uuid>",
  description: "Updated description with more detail...",
  dependsOnDraftUuids: ["<other-draft-uuid>"]
})

# Remove a draft that's no longer needed
chorus_pm_remove_task_draft({
  proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  draftUuid: "<draft-uuid>"
})
```

### Step 9: Submit Proposal for Review

When the proposal is ready:

```
chorus_pm_submit_proposal({ proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>" })
```

This changes the proposal status from `draft` to `pending`. An Admin will review it.

Add a comment explaining your reasoning:

```
chorus_add_comment({
  targetType: "proposal",
  targetUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  content: "This proposal covers... Key decisions: ..."
})
```

### Step 10: Update Idea Status

Mark the idea as pending review:

```
chorus_update_idea_status({ ideaUuid: "<idea-uuid>", status: "pending_review" })
```

### Step 11: Handle Feedback

If the proposal is rejected, check the review note:

```
chorus_get_proposal({ proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>" })
chorus_get_comments({ targetType: "proposal", targetUuid: "<proposal-uuid>" })
```

Revise the drafts and resubmit.

### Step 12: Post-Approval

When the Admin approves the proposal:
- Document drafts are automatically materialized into real Documents
- Task drafts are automatically materialized into real Tasks (status: `open`)
- Developers can now claim and work on the tasks

Mark the idea as completed:

```
chorus_update_idea_status({ ideaUuid: "<idea-uuid>", status: "completed" })
```

### Step 13: Manage Task Dependencies (Optional)

After tasks are created (either via proposal approval or `chorus_pm_create_tasks`), you can manage dependencies between them.

**Add dependency using `chorus_pm_create_tasks` with intra-batch dependencies:**

```
chorus_pm_create_tasks({
  projectUuid: "<project-uuid>",
  tasks: [
    {
      draftUuid: "draft-db",
      title: "Create database schema",
      priority: "high",
      storyPoints: 2
    },
    {
      draftUuid: "draft-api",
      title: "Implement API endpoints",
      priority: "high",
      storyPoints: 4,
      dependsOnDraftUuids: ["draft-db"]
    },
    {
      title: "Write integration tests",
      priority: "medium",
      storyPoints: 2,
      dependsOnDraftUuids: ["draft-api"],
      dependsOnTaskUuids: ["<existing-task-uuid>"]
    }
  ]
})
```

**Add/remove dependencies on existing tasks:**

```
# Add dependency: task B depends on task A
chorus_add_task_dependency({
  taskUuid: "<task-B-uuid>",
  dependsOnTaskUuid: "<task-A-uuid>"
})

# Remove dependency
chorus_remove_task_dependency({
  taskUuid: "<task-B-uuid>",
  dependsOnTaskUuid: "<task-A-uuid>"
})
```

**Notes:**
- Dependencies are validated: same project, no self-dependency, no cycles (DFS detection)
- Use `chorus_get_task` to see `dependsOn` and `dependedBy` arrays

### Step 14: Assign Tasks to Developer Agents (Optional)

After approval, you can directly assign tasks to specific Developer Agents instead of waiting for them to self-claim:

```
chorus_pm_assign_task({
  taskUuid: "<task-uuid>",
  agentUuid: "<developer-agent-uuid>"
})
```

**Conditions:**
- Task must be in `open` or `assigned` status (reassignment is allowed)
- Target agent must have `developer` or `developer_agent` role
- The PM Agent is recorded as `assignedBy`

To find available developer agents, use the project activity or check with the admin. To find open tasks:

```
chorus_get_available_tasks({ projectUuid: "<project-uuid>" })
```

## Document Writing Guidelines

### PRD Structure
```markdown
# PRD: <Feature Name>

## Background
Why this feature is needed.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- FR-1: ...
- FR-2: ...

### Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR-1: ...

## User Stories
- As a <role>, I want <action>, so that <benefit>

## Out of Scope
What is NOT included in this proposal.
```

### Tech Design Structure
```markdown
# Technical Design: <Feature Name>

## Overview
High-level approach.

## Architecture
System design, component interactions.

## Data Model
Schema changes, new tables.

## API Design
New/modified endpoints.

## Implementation Plan
Step-by-step implementation order.

## Risks & Mitigations
Potential issues and how to address them.
```

### Task Writing Guidelines

Good tasks are:
- **Atomic** - One clear deliverable per task
- **Testable** - Clear acceptance criteria
- **Sized** - 1-8 story points (hours of agent work)
- **Ordered** - Use `dependsOnDraftUuids` / `dependsOnTaskUuids` to express execution order when tasks have real prerequisites
- **Descriptive** - Include enough context for a developer agent to start without questions

## Tips

- When combining multiple ideas, explain in the proposal description how they relate
- Keep PRD focused on *what* and *why*; keep tech design focused on *how*
- Break large features into multiple smaller tasks rather than one monolithic task
- Add `storyPoints` to help prioritize and estimate effort
- Use `acceptanceCriteria` with checkboxes for clear verification
