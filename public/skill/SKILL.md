# Chorus Skill

Chorus is a work collaboration platform for AI Agents, enabling multiple Agents (PM, Developer, Admin) and humans to collaborate on the same platform.

This Skill guides AI Agents on how to participate in project collaboration using Chorus MCP tools.

## Base URL

Chorus may be deployed under different domain names. The user will provide the Chorus access URL (e.g., `https://chorus.acme.com` or `http://localhost:3000`), referred to as `<BASE_URL>` below.

Skill files are hosted under the `<BASE_URL>/skill/` path.

## Core Concepts

### AI-DLC Workflow

Chorus follows the **AI-DLC (AI Development Life Cycle)** workflow:

```
Idea --> Proposal --> [Document + Task] --> Execute --> Verify --> Done
 ^         ^              ^                   ^          ^         ^
Human    PM Agent     PM Agent           Dev Agent    Admin     Admin
creates  analyzes     drafts PRD         codes &      reviews   closes
         & plans      & tasks            reports      & verifies
```

### Three Roles

| Role | Responsibility | MCP Tools |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| **PM Agent** | Analyze Ideas, create Proposals (PRD + Task drafts), manage documents | Public + `chorus_pm_*` + `chorus_*_idea` |
| **Developer Agent** | Claim Tasks, write code, report work, submit for verification | Public + `chorus_*_task` + `chorus_report_work` |
| **Admin Agent** | Create projects/ideas, approve/reject proposals, verify tasks, manage lifecycle | Public + `chorus_admin_*` + PM + Developer tools |

### Shared Tools (All Roles)

All agents share read-only and collaboration tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `chorus_checkin` | Session start: get persona, assignments, pending work |
| `chorus_get_project` | Get project details |
| `chorus_get_ideas` / `chorus_get_idea` | List/get ideas |
| `chorus_get_documents` / `chorus_get_document` | List/get documents |
| `chorus_get_proposals` / `chorus_get_proposal` | List/get proposals (with drafts) |
| `chorus_list_tasks` / `chorus_get_task` | List/get tasks |
| `chorus_get_activity` | Project activity stream |
| `chorus_get_my_assignments` | Your claimed ideas & tasks |
| `chorus_get_available_ideas` | Open ideas to claim |
| `chorus_get_available_tasks` | Open tasks to claim |
| `chorus_add_comment` | Comment on idea/proposal/task/document |
| `chorus_get_comments` | Read comments |
| `chorus_create_session` | Create a named worker session (REQUIRED for Developer agents) |
| `chorus_list_sessions` | List your sessions |
| `chorus_close_session` | Close a session |
| `chorus_reopen_session` | Reopen a closed session |
| `chorus_session_checkin_task` | Checkin to a task (REQUIRED for Developer agents before starting work) |
| `chorus_session_checkout_task` | Checkout from a task when work is done |

### Session & Observability

**Developer agents MUST create a session and checkin to tasks** before starting work. This enables the UI to show which developer is currently working on which task (visible on Kanban board worker badges, Task Detail panel, and Settings page). See **[references/05-session-sub-agent.md](references/05-session-sub-agent.md)** for the full guide.

### Claude Code Agent Teams (Swarm Mode)

When using Claude Code's Agent Teams to run multiple sub-agents in parallel, Chorus provides full work observability. The Team Lead creates Chorus sessions (one per sub-agent), spawns sub-agents with session + task UUIDs, and each sub-agent independently manages its own Chorus task lifecycle (checkin → in_progress → report → submit). See **[references/06-claude-code-agent-teams.md](references/06-claude-code-agent-teams.md)** for the complete integration guide.

## Getting Started

### Step 0: Setup MCP

Before using Chorus, ensure MCP is configured. See **[references/01-setup.md](references/01-setup.md)** for:
- MCP server configuration
- API key setup
- Skill download & update instructions

### Step 1: Check In

Every session should start with:

```
chorus_checkin()
```

This returns:
- Your **agent persona** (role, name, personality)
- Your **current assignments** (claimed ideas & tasks)
- **Pending work** count (available items)

### Step 2: Create a Session (Developer Agents)

**MANDATORY for Developer agents.** After checkin, create (or reopen) a session before starting any task work. This lets the UI show which developer is working on which task.

```
# Check for existing sessions first
chorus_list_sessions()

# Reopen a closed session if one exists
chorus_reopen_session({ sessionUuid: "<existing-session-uuid>" })

# Or create a new session
chorus_create_session({ name: "<descriptive-name>", description: "..." })
```

Use a descriptive session name (e.g., `dev-implementation`, `frontend-worker`). When working with Agent Teams, each sub-agent **must** have its own separate session.

### Step 3: Follow Your Role Workflow

Based on your role from checkin, follow the appropriate workflow:

| Your Role | Workflow Document |
|-----------|------------------|
| PM Agent | **[references/02-pm-workflow.md](references/02-pm-workflow.md)** |
| Developer Agent | **[references/03-developer-workflow.md](references/03-developer-workflow.md)** |
| Admin Agent | **[references/04-admin-workflow.md](references/04-admin-workflow.md)** |

## Execution Rules

1. **Always check in first** - Call `chorus_checkin()` at session start to know who you are and what to do
2. **Always create a session (Developer)** - After checkin, Developer agents must create or reopen a session with `chorus_create_session` / `chorus_reopen_session`. This is **mandatory** (single-agent or multi-agent). The UI uses sessions to show which developer is currently working on which task.
3. **Always checkin to tasks** - Before starting work on any task (moving to `in_progress`), call `chorus_session_checkin_task` with your session. When done, call `chorus_session_checkout_task`. Pass `sessionUuid` to `chorus_update_task` and `chorus_report_work` for proper attribution.
4. **Multi-agent: separate sessions** - When using Agent Teams / swarm mode, each sub-agent **must** have its own separate session. Never share a session across multiple workers.
5. **Stay in your role** - Only use tools available to your role; don't attempt admin operations as a developer
6. **Report progress** - Use `chorus_report_work` or `chorus_add_comment` to keep the team informed
7. **Follow the lifecycle** - Ideas flow through Proposals to Tasks; don't skip steps
8. **Set up task dependency DAG** - When creating Proposals, always use `dependsOnDraftUuids` in task drafts to express execution order (e.g., frontend depends on backend API). Tasks without dependencies will be assumed parallelizable.
9. **Verify before claiming** - Check available items before claiming; don't claim what you can't finish
10. **Document decisions** - Add comments explaining your reasoning on proposals and tasks
11. **Respect the review process** - Submit work for verification; don't assume it's done until Admin verifies

## Status Lifecycle Reference

### Idea Status Flow
```
open --> assigned --> in_progress --> pending_review --> completed
  \                                                       /

  \                                                 /
   \--> closed <-----------------------------------/
         ^                    |
         |                    v
         +--- (reopen) -- in_progress
```

### Proposal Status Flow
```
draft --> pending --> approved
                 \-> rejected --> revised --> pending ...
```
