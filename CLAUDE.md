# CLAUDE.md — Chorus Project Guide

## What is Chorus

Chorus is an AI Agent & Human collaboration platform implementing the **AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Lifecycle)** workflow. Multiple AI Agents (PM, Developer, Admin) and humans work together through a shared Idea → Proposal → Document + Task → Execute → Verify → Done pipeline.

Core philosophy: **"Reversed Conversation"** — AI proposes, humans verify (not human prompt → AI execute).

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router, Turbopack for dev)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5 (strict mode)
- **Frontend**: React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui (Radix UI)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16, Prisma ORM 7
- **Auth**: OIDC (users), API Keys with `cho_` prefix (agents), SuperAdmin (env-based bcrypt)
- **MCP**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk 1.26 (HTTP Streamable Transport)
- **i18n**: next-intl (en, zh)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm 9.15
- **Path alias**: `@/*` → `./src/*`

## Architecture Patterns

### UUID-First

All entities use UUIDs as public identifiers. URLs, API params, and cross-entity references all use UUIDs. Never expose database serial IDs.

### Service Layer

Business logic lives in `src/services/*.service.ts`. API routes and MCP tools both call service functions — never put business logic directly in routes or tools.

### Auth Context

Every request resolves to an `AuthContext` with `type` ("user" | "agent" | "super_admin"), `companyUuid`, and `actorUuid`. The `getAuthContext(request)` function in `src/lib/auth.ts` checks: Bearer token (API Key or OIDC) → Session cookie (SuperAdmin) → Dev headers (`x-user-uuid` + `x-company-uuid`).

Agent auth carries `roles: string[]` (pm_agent, developer_agent, admin_agent) which determines MCP tool visibility.

### Polymorphic Assignment

Tasks and Ideas use `assigneeType` ("user" | "agent") + `assigneeUuid` for flexible assignment to either humans or AI agents.

### MCP Server

The MCP endpoint at `POST /api/mcp` creates per-session server instances. Each session is tied to an authenticated agent. Tools are registered based on the agent's roles. Sessions auto-expire after 30 minutes of inactivity.

Tool registration pattern:
```typescript
server.registerTool("tool_name", {
  description: "...",
  inputSchema: z.object({ /* zod schema */ }),
}, async (params) => {
  const result = await someService.doSomething(auth.companyUuid, ...);
  return { content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(result, null, 2) }] };
});
```

### Agent Sessions (Swarm Mode)

When agents spawn sub-agents (e.g., Claude Code Agent Teams), they create **Sessions** for observability. Lifecycle: `active ↔ inactive (1h no heartbeat) → closed → (reopen) → active`. Sessions checkin/checkout from tasks to track which worker is on which task.

### Activity Stream

`src/services/activity.service.ts` logs all significant actions. Activities support `sessionUuid` + `sessionName` for sub-agent attribution (denormalized for query efficiency).

## Database Notes

- **14 Prisma models**: Company, User, Agent, ApiKey, Project, Idea, Document, Task, TaskDependency, Proposal, Comment, Activity, AgentSession, SessionTaskCheckin
- **relationMode = "prisma"**: Prisma handles relations in application code, not DB foreign keys
- **Cascade deletes**: Configured at Prisma level (onDelete: Cascade)
- **After schema changes**: Must run `npx prisma generate` to regenerate client, then restart the dev server to pick up new models. Forgetting this causes `prisma.newModel` to be `undefined` at runtime.

## API Response Format

All REST APIs return:
```json
{ "success": true, "data": { ... } }
{ "success": false, "error": "Error message" }
```

Use helpers from `src/lib/api-response.ts`: `success(data)`, `errors.notFound("Entity")`, `errors.badRequest("msg")`, `errors.unauthorized()`, `errors.forbidden("msg")`.

Use `withErrorHandler<T>()` from `src/lib/api-handler.ts` to wrap route handlers for consistent error handling.

## i18n Rules

- Two locales: `en`, `zh` (messages in `/messages/en.json`, `/messages/zh.json`)
- Always add keys to **both** locale files when adding UI strings
- Use `useTranslations()` hook in client components, `getTranslations()` in server components
- Keys are nested objects: `common.save`, `sessions.reopen`, `activity.taskAssigned`

## Skill Documentation

Files under `public/skill/` are served as static assets and consumed by agents as MCP Skill references. **All skill docs must be written in English.** These include:
- `SKILL.md` — Main overview and role routing
- `references/00-common-tools.md` — Shared tools reference
- `references/01-setup.md` — MCP configuration guide
- `references/02-pm-workflow.md` — PM Agent workflow
- `references/03-developer-workflow.md` — Developer Agent workflow
- `references/04-admin-workflow.md` — Admin Agent workflow
- `references/05-session-sub-agent.md` — Session & Sub-Agent (Swarm Mode) guide

When adding new MCP tools, update both `docs/MCP_TOOLS.md` (internal reference) and the relevant skill docs under `public/skill/`.

## MCP Tool Roles

| Scope | Who | Prefix |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Public | All agents | `chorus_get_*`, `chorus_list_*`, `chorus_checkin`, `chorus_add_comment` |
| Session | All agents | `chorus_create_session`, `chorus_list_sessions`, `chorus_reopen_session`, ... |
| Developer | developer_agent | `chorus_claim_task`, `chorus_update_task`, `chorus_report_work`, ... |
| PM | pm_agent | `chorus_pm_create_proposal`, `chorus_pm_create_tasks`, `chorus_claim_idea`, ... |
| Admin | admin_agent | `chorus_admin_create_project`, `chorus_admin_verify_task`, ... |

## Mandatory Workflow Rules

### 1. Update design.pen on Every Feature

When implementing any user-facing feature or UI change, you **must** update `docs/design.pen` to reflect the new or modified screens/components. Use the Pencil MCP tools (`get_editor_state`, `open_document`, `batch_design`, `get_screenshot`, etc.) to read and write `.pen` files — never use Read/Grep directly on `.pen` files as their contents are encrypted.

### 2. Full Lifecycle Tracking in Chorus

Every requirement — from idea to completion — must be tracked in Chorus through its full lifecycle:

- **Create an Idea** for the requirement (or use an existing one)
- **Create a Proposal** with document drafts (PRD) and task drafts. **Always set up task dependency DAG** using `dependsOnDraftUuids` in task drafts — e.g., frontend tasks depend on backend API tasks, integration tests depend on both. Tasks without proper dependencies will be worked on in parallel, which may cause failures if there are implicit ordering requirements.
- **Approve the Proposal** to materialize tasks (dependencies are preserved)
- **Claim and work on Tasks**, reporting progress with `chorus_report_work`. Respect the DAG — only start a task when its dependencies are done.
- **Submit for verification** when done, then Admin verifies

For large features, create a **dedicated Chorus Project** to isolate tracking. Use `chorus_admin_create_project` to set one up, then create ideas and proposals within that project scope.

### 3. Agent Team Sessions are Mandatory

When using Claude Code Agent Teams (swarm mode with sub-agents), you **must** use Chorus Session tools for sub-agent-level observability:

**Team Lead responsibilities:**
- **Before spawning sub-agents**: Call `chorus_list_sessions` to check for reusable sessions. Reopen closed sessions with `chorus_reopen_session` instead of creating new ones.
- **Create sessions**: Each sub-agent gets its own session via `chorus_create_session` with a descriptive name (e.g., "frontend-worker", "backend-worker").
- **Assign work**: Pass the Chorus task UUIDs and session UUID to each sub-agent when spawning. After that, **all task management is the sub-agent's responsibility** — the team lead does not checkin, move status, or report work on behalf of sub-agents.
- **Monitor completion**: The team lead's ongoing role is to check that all Chorus tasks reach `to_verify` / `done` and no tasks are missed. Use `chorus_list_tasks` to verify status.
- **Close sessions**: When sub-agents finish, close their sessions with `chorus_close_session`.

**Sub-Agent responsibilities (each sub-agent manages its own tasks end-to-end):**
- **Checkin to tasks**: When starting work on a task, call `chorus_session_checkin_task` with its own sessionUuid. Checkout when done.
- **Move task status**: The sub-agent moves its own task through the lifecycle: `assigned → in_progress → to_verify`. The team lead must NOT move tasks on behalf of sub-agents.
- **Pass sessionUuid**: When calling `chorus_report_work` or `chorus_update_task`, always include the `sessionUuid` parameter so activity is attributed to the correct sub-agent.
- **Report work**: Call `chorus_report_work` to log progress and `chorus_submit_for_verify` when done.
- **Heartbeat**: Long-running sub-agents should call `chorus_session_heartbeat` periodically (sessions become inactive after 1 hour without heartbeat).

This ensures every action is traceable to the specific sub-agent that performed it, visible in the Settings page, Kanban board worker badges, and Task Detail panel.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Prisma client stale after schema change**: If you modify `prisma/schema.prisma`, you must run `npx prisma generate` AND restart the dev server. The running process caches the old Prisma client in memory.

2. **MCP session expiry**: MCP sessions expire after 30 minutes. The client must handle 404 by reinitializing.

3. **Multi-tenancy**: All queries must be scoped by `companyUuid`. Never return data across company boundaries.

4. **API Key format**: Keys start with `cho_` prefix, followed by base64url-encoded random bytes. Stored as SHA-256 hash in DB. The raw key is shown only once at creation time.

5. **Proposal is a container**: A Proposal holds `documentDrafts` (JSON) and `taskDrafts` (JSON). On approval, these drafts materialize into real Document and Task entities. Don't confuse drafts with actual entities.

6. **Task dependencies form a DAG**: Use `TaskDependency` model. Frontend renders with @xyflow/react + dagre for layout. Circular dependency detection is handled at the service level.

7. **design.pen is encrypted**: The `docs/design.pen` file can only be read/written through the Pencil MCP tools. Never use Read/Grep on `.pen` files.

8. **Server Components vs Client Components**: Default to Server Components. Only add `"use client"` when you need interactivity (useState, useEffect, event handlers). Server Actions (`"use server"`) are used for mutations called from client components.
