# OpenSpec Mode

OpenSpec mode is an opt-in authoring style for Chorus PM agents. When the agent has the [`openspec`](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) CLI installed locally, the proposal-authoring flow switches from free-form Markdown to a structured `proposal.md` + `design.md` + `specs/<capability>/spec.md` layout that lives on disk and is mirrored into Chorus `documentDrafts` via the plugin's MCP wrapper script. The local files are the working copy; the Chorus drafts are a mirror that reviewers can read on the proposal page.

This document is a user-facing summary. The authoritative behavior lives in two hand-maintained skill files:

- **Claude Code plugin:** [`public/chorus-plugin/skills/openspec-aware/SKILL.md`](../public/chorus-plugin/skills/openspec-aware/SKILL.md) — uses `chorus-api.sh mcp-tool` as the wrapper.
- **Codex plugin:** [`plugins/chorus/skills/openspec-aware/SKILL.md`](../plugins/chorus/skills/openspec-aware/SKILL.md) — uses `chorus-mcp-call.sh` (different invocation shape; no `mcp-tool` subcommand).

The two skills carry the same core logic, but each is hand-edited to match its plugin's wrapper path, conventions, and host runtime. **There is no shared canonical file and no sync script.** When this guide diverges from a SKILL.md, the SKILL.md wins.

OpenSpec mode is **not** available for the standalone `public/skill/` distribution — that channel ships no plugin wrappers, so the wrapper-driven mirror flow has no implementation there.

## What it does

OpenSpec mode gives every spec draft on a Proposal a predictable shape: top-level delta blocks (`## ADDED Requirements`, `## MODIFIED Requirements`, `## REMOVED Requirements`, `## RENAMED Requirements`) containing `### Requirement:` entries with `SHALL` / `MUST` wording, and `#### Scenario:` blocks written in `**WHEN** ... **THEN** ...` form. Reviewers (human and agent) can lean on that structure instead of reading every PRD as a free-form essay. When OpenSpec is **not** installed, behavior is unchanged: drafts are free-form Markdown.

The mode is purely client-side. **Chorus 0.8.0 ships no new MCP tools, no schema changes, and no server-side OpenSpec awareness.** The skill authors local files with `openspec`, then calls the same `chorus_pm_create_proposal` / `chorus_pm_add_document_draft` / `chorus_pm_update_document_draft` / `chorus_pm_update_document` tools that already existed — but for document mirror calls, it goes through the plugin's wrapper script (`chorus-api.sh` for Claude Code, `chorus-mcp-call.sh` for Codex) so file content streams through `jq -Rs '.'` byte-for-byte instead of being re-emitted by the LLM.

---

## When it activates (detection contract)

Detection runs **once per session**, in the plugin's SessionStart hook (`bin/on-session-start.sh` for Claude Code, `hooks/on-session-start.sh` for Codex). The hook computes a single value `CHORUS_OPENSPEC_ACTIVE` and writes a `## OpenSpec Mode` section into the developer-message / additional-context block. Stage skills (proposal, develop, yolo) read that value when they need to branch — they do not re-detect.

`CHORUS_OPENSPEC_ACTIVE=1` requires **all three** of:

1. `CHORUS_OPENSPEC_MODE` is **not** set to `off` (explicit opt-out wins).
2. The project root contains an `openspec/` directory — i.e. someone has run `openspec init` here. This is the "this repo intends to use OpenSpec" signal.
3. The `openspec` CLI is on `PATH`. The OpenSpec authoring path needs the CLI to scaffold (`openspec new change`), validate, and archive — the folder alone is not enough.

If any check fails, the hook still writes `## OpenSpec Mode` into context with `CHORUS_OPENSPEC_ACTIVE=0` and a one-line reason ("CHORUS_OPENSPEC_MODE=off (explicit opt-out)" / "no openspec/ directory at …" / "openspec/ directory present but `openspec` CLI not on PATH"). When the folder is present but the CLI is missing, the user-visible toast also surfaces an install hint:

```
Chorus connected at <URL> (OpenSpec repo detected — install with: npm i -g @fission-ai/openspec)
```

The agent should pass that hint through to the user instead of silently choosing the free-form path.

When all three signals hold, the user-visible toast looks like:

```
Chorus connected at <URL> (OpenSpec Enabled)
```

### Why folder + CLI both, not just one

Either signal alone leaves the workflow unrunnable:

- Folder without CLI: `openspec new change "$SLUG"` errors immediately — there's nothing to scaffold with. Activating OpenSpec mode in this state would point the agent at a dead end.
- CLI without folder: `openspec new change` complains it's not in a project ("Run `openspec init` first"). The repo isn't OpenSpec-init'd, so this likely isn't where OpenSpec is wanted.

Requiring both makes the activation predicate match what's actually needed at runtime.

### Sub-agents and sub-shells

Detection runs in the plugin's session-start hook, which fires once per top-level session. Sub-agents that get the parent's context forwarded inherit `CHORUS_OPENSPEC_ACTIVE` for free. If you spawn a sub-agent without forwarding context, the `openspec-aware` skill §1 has a manual fallback block that performs the same three checks locally — use only when SessionStart context is genuinely unavailable.

## Install + initialize

OpenSpec is a Node CLI from Fission AI. Install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec
openspec --version    # Chorus 0.8.0 was tested against 1.3.1
```

Then, inside the repository where the agent will author proposals:

```bash
openspec init
```

`openspec init` creates the `openspec/` working directory (`changes/`, `specs/`, `config.yaml`, instruction files). Without it, the `openspec new change <slug>` step in the skill's §3.2 will fail.

---

## Opt-out

Two switches, in precedence order:

**1. `enableOpenSpec` userConfig toggle** (Claude Code plugin only, default `true`). Configurable from the plugin install UI like the reviewer toggles. When set to `false`, SessionStart detection short-circuits with reason `enableOpenSpec userConfig=false (plugin-level opt-out)`, and the post-verify archive hook also exits 0 immediately. Equivalent to "OpenSpec is uninstalled" from the agent's perspective.

**2. `CHORUS_OPENSPEC_MODE=off` env var** (both plugins). Per-shell / CI-friendly opt-out:

```bash
export CHORUS_OPENSPEC_MODE=off
```

This forces fallback mode even when both the `openspec/` directory and the `openspec` CLI are present. The SessionStart hook checks the userConfig toggle first, then this env var, before the folder/CLI signals. The reason recorded in the `## OpenSpec Mode` context block when env-off wins is exactly:

```
CHORUS_OPENSPEC_ACTIVE=0 (CHORUS_OPENSPEC_MODE=off (explicit opt-out))
```

After detection, no `openspec/` folder is created or referenced (existing folders on disk are untouched), and the proposal description gets no `OpenSpec change slug:` line. Behavior is identical to a host that doesn't have OpenSpec installed.

The Codex plugin has no userConfig surface, so only the env var applies there.

## What gets mirrored to Chorus

| OpenSpec local file | Chorus `Document.type` | Mirrored? |
|---|---|---|
| `openspec/changes/<slug>/proposal.md` | `prd` | yes |
| `openspec/changes/<slug>/design.md` | `tech_design` | yes |
| `openspec/changes/<slug>/specs/<capability>/spec.md` | `spec` | yes (one draft per capability) |
| `openspec/changes/<slug>/tasks.md` | _(not mapped)_ | **no** |

All three mapped types (`prd`, `tech_design`, `spec`) are pre-existing valid `Document.type` values — no schema change required.

The proposal description must contain a single line in the exact format `OpenSpec change slug: <slug>` so the post-verify-task hook (and future runs of the skill) can recover the slug from a fresh shell.

## How mirror calls are made (Rule 1)

This is the rule most likely to bite you, so it gets its own section.

When `CHORUS_OPENSPEC_ACTIVE=1`, **every** call to `chorus_pm_add_document_draft`, `chorus_pm_update_document_draft`, or `chorus_pm_update_document` MUST go through the plugin's wrapper script with `content` produced by `json_encode_file` (defined in the skill's §3.4):

- Claude Code: `chorus-api.sh mcp-tool <tool_name> "$PAYLOAD"` (on `PATH`)
- Codex: `"$CHORUS_PLUGIN_DIR/hooks/chorus-mcp-call.sh" <tool_name> "$PAYLOAD"`

Calling these tools directly from the agent's MCP harness with a hand-typed `content` field is a **protocol violation** in OpenSpec mode and will fail review. Three reasons (full version in skill §2 Rule 1):

1. **Token cost.** Re-typing thousands of lines of markdown body through the LLM burns 20k+ content tokens per proposal. The wrapper streams bytes through `jq -Rs '.'`; content never enters LLM context.
2. **Byte-equality.** `jq -Rs '.'` is a byte-faithful encoder. LLM re-emission of long markdown drifts (table alignment, fence escapes, long-URL wraps). The byte-equality guarantee (modulo trailing `\n`) holds **only** on the wrapper path.
3. **Single source of truth.** With the wrapper, the local `openspec/changes/<slug>/*.md` is authoritative; Chorus is a mirror. With agent re-typing, authority splits and a future diff cannot tell which side is correct.

Free-form mode (`CHORUS_OPENSPEC_ACTIVE=0`) is unaffected — there's no local file to mirror, so direct MCP calls with inline `content` are still the right pattern.

## FAQ

### What happens if I edit the local file but not Chorus?

The local file under `openspec/changes/<slug>/` is the working copy. The Chorus draft is a mirror written by the wrapper-driven `chorus_pm_add_document_draft` / `chorus_pm_update_document_draft` calls. If you edit the local file out-of-band, the mirror drifts.

To resync, re-run the relevant mirror snippet from `openspec-aware` §3.7. Same wrapper, same `json_encode_file`, same `chorus_check_response` halt-on-error.

The Chorus backend appends a single trailing `\n` on write, so a round-trip is byte-equal **modulo a trailing newline**. Don't read that 1-byte diff as content drift.

After approval the draft becomes a Document with a fresh `documentUuid`. Use `chorus_pm_update_document` (skill §3.8) instead of `chorus_pm_update_document_draft`.

### What about `openspec archive`?

After the **last** task of an OpenSpec-mode idea is verified via `chorus_admin_verify_task`, both the Claude Code and Codex plugins' PostToolUse hook automatically inject a reminder telling the main agent to run `openspec archive <slug>` and mirror the resulting `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` files back to the corresponding Chorus Documents via `chorus_pm_update_document` (still through the wrapper).

The hook fires only when:

- the proposal description carries an `OpenSpec change slug: <slug>` line, AND
- the `openspec` CLI is on `PATH`, AND
- every task under the proposal is `done`.

Otherwise it exits 0 silently. See `openspec-aware` §3.9 for the full agent action sequence (run with `-y` / `--yes`, halt on error, byte-equal round-trip check).

### Why isn't `tasks.md` mirrored?

OpenSpec's `tasks.md` is the OpenSpec-side task list. Chorus already has its own task model — task drafts on the Proposal, materialized into Tasks with acceptance criteria, dependencies, assignees, and status — and that is the source of truth for task tracking. Mirroring `tasks.md` would duplicate state and create a second place to keep in sync. The skill explicitly skips it.

If you want Chorus tasks to reflect a `tasks.md`, write the Chorus task drafts directly via `chorus_pm_add_task_draft` (no wrapper required — task drafts are not document content).

## Known limitations (0.8.0)

- **`chorus-api.sh mcp-tool` is silent on HTTP 4xx.** Known wrapper bug in `public/chorus-plugin/bin/chorus-api.sh`: on HTTP 4xx (e.g. `401 Unauthorized` from a bad `CHORUS_API_KEY`), the wrapper's final `jq -r '.result.content[]?'` filter produces empty stdout, and the wrapper itself exits **0**. A bare `RC=$?` check would not halt on the most common runtime failure mode. The skill works around this with a `chorus_check_response` helper that checks **three** signals (wrapper exit code, `"error":` field in body, empty body) and halts on any of them. Every mirror call in the skill uses this helper. See `openspec-aware` §6 for the helper and rationale. The wrapper bug itself is tracked separately and out of scope for 0.8.0.

- **Materialized-Document path requires re-deriving UUIDs.** After approval, the draft's `draftUuid` no longer applies; the Document has a fresh `documentUuid`. From a fresh shell you re-derive it via `chorus_get_documents` for the proposal's project, matching by `title` and `type`, and re-derive `$SLUG` by grepping the proposal description for `^OpenSpec change slug: `. See skill §3.8.

- **Standalone `public/skill/` distribution does not support OpenSpec mode.** The standalone skill ships without a plugin wrapper. Since wrapper-driven mirror is mandatory in OpenSpec mode, the standalone channel skips it entirely. Users on that channel always run free-form.
