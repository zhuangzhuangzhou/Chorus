# Proposal Skill

This skill covers the **Planning** stage of the AI-DLC workflow: creating Proposals that contain document drafts (PRD, tech design) and task drafts with dependency DAGs, then submitting them for Admin review.

---

## Overview

After an Idea's elaboration is resolved (see `/idea`), the PM Agent creates a Proposal — a container that holds document drafts and task drafts. On Admin approval, these drafts materialize into real Documents and Tasks.

```
Elaboration resolved --> Create Proposal --> Add drafts --> Validate --> Submit --> Admin review
```

### Proposal Lifecycle

```
draft --> pending --> approved
                \--> rejected --> (revise drafts) --> pending  (resubmit cycle)
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `draft` | Proposal is being built — add/edit document and task drafts |
| `pending` | Submitted for Admin review |
| `approved` | Admin approved — drafts materialized into real Documents and Tasks |
| `rejected` | Admin rejected with feedback — revise drafts and resubmit |

A rejected proposal returns to `draft` status. Fix issues based on the review note, then validate and resubmit.

---

## Tools

**Proposal Management:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `chorus_create_proposal` | Create an empty proposal container linked to input ideas |
| `chorus_get_proposal` | Get full proposal details including all document and task drafts |
| `chorus_validate_proposal` | Validate proposal completeness (returns errors, warnings, info) |
| `chorus_submit_proposal` | Submit proposal for Admin approval (draft -> pending) |

**Document Drafts:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `chorus_add_document_draft` | Add a document draft to the proposal |
| `chorus_update_document_draft` | Update document draft title, type, or content |
| `chorus_remove_document_draft` | Remove a document draft from the proposal |

**Task Drafts:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `chorus_add_task_draft` | Add a task draft (returns draftUuid for dependency chaining) |
| `chorus_update_task_draft` | Update task draft fields or dependencies |
| `chorus_remove_task_draft` | Remove a task draft from the proposal |

**Post-Approval (tasks exist):**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `chorus_create_tasks` | Batch create tasks with intra-batch dependencies (also supports Quick Task mode) |
| `chorus_update_task` | Update task fields, dependencies, or status |
| `chorus_pm_assign_task` | Assign a task to a Developer Agent |

**Shared tools** (checkin, query, comment, search, notifications): see `/chorus`

---

## SSE Wake Events (OpenClaw-Specific)

OpenClaw is a single-agent model with SSE-driven wake. The following notification events trigger the agent to wake and act on proposals:

| SSE Event | Trigger | Agent Action |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| `proposal_rejected` | Admin rejected your proposal | Wake, read review note, revise drafts, resubmit |
| `proposal_approved` | Admin approved your proposal | Wake, update idea status, check new tasks ready for work |

When a proposal is rejected, the event router provides the review note and instructs the agent to fix issues. When approved, it notifies that documents and tasks have been created.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Create an Empty Proposal

Create the proposal container first, then incrementally add drafts.

```
chorus_create_proposal({
  projectUuid: "<project-uuid>",
  title: "Implement <feature name>",
  description: "Analysis and implementation plan for Idea #xxx",
  inputType: "idea",
  inputUuids: ["<idea-uuid>"]
})
```

**Multiple Ideas:** You can combine multiple ideas into one proposal by passing multiple UUIDs in `inputUuids`.

### Step 2: Add Document Drafts

Add document drafts one at a time.

**Document types:** `prd`, `tech_design`, `adr`, `spec`, `guide`

```
# Add PRD
chorus_add_document_draft({
  proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  type: "prd",
  title: "PRD: <Feature Name>",
  content: "# PRD: <Feature Name>\n\n## Background\n...\n## Requirements\n..."
})

# Add Tech Design
chorus_add_document_draft({
  proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  type: "tech_design",
  title: "Tech Design: <Feature Name>",
  content: "# Technical Design\n\n## Architecture\n...\n## Implementation\n..."
})
```

#### Document Type Guidelines

| Type | Focus | When to Use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `prd` | What and why — requirements, user stories, scope | Every feature proposal |
| `tech_design` | How — architecture, data model, API design | Features with non-trivial implementation |
| `adr` | Architecture Decision Record — decision context, options, outcome | Significant architectural choices |
| `spec` | Detailed specification — protocols, formats, interfaces | API contracts, data formats |
| `guide` | How-to guide — setup, usage, runbooks | Operational procedures |

### Step 3: Add Task Drafts with Dependency DAG

Add task drafts one at a time. Each response returns the new draft's `draftUuid` — use it in `dependsOnDraftUuids` for subsequent drafts to build the dependency DAG.

```
# First task (no dependencies) -> response includes { draftUuid, draftTitle }
chorus_add_task_draft({
  proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  title: "Create database schema",
  description: "Add new tables for ...",
  priority: "high",
  storyPoints: 2,
  acceptanceCriteriaItems: [
    { description: "Migration runs without errors", required: true },
    { description: "Rollback migration works", required: true }
  ]
})

# Second task — depends on first
chorus_add_task_draft({
  proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  title: "Implement API endpoints",
  description: "REST endpoints for ...",
  priority: "high",
  storyPoints: 4,
  acceptanceCriteriaItems: [
    { description: "All endpoints return correct responses", required: true },
    { description: "Input validation covers edge cases", required: true },
    { description: "OpenAPI spec updated", required: false }
  ],
  dependsOnDraftUuids: ["<draftUuid-from-first-task>"]
})

# Third task — depends on second
chorus_add_task_draft({
  proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  title: "Write integration tests",
  description: "End-to-end tests covering ...",
  priority: "medium",
  storyPoints: 2,
  acceptanceCriteriaItems: [
    { description: "Test coverage > 80%", required: true }
  ],
  dependsOnDraftUuids: ["<draftUuid-from-second-task>"]
})
```

**Task priority:** `low`, `medium`, `high`

**Dependency DAG rules:**
- `dependsOnDraftUuids` references other task drafts *within the same proposal*
- Dependencies form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) — no circular dependencies allowed
- Tasks without dependencies are assumed parallelizable
- On approval, draft dependencies become real task dependencies

### Step 4: Review and Refine Drafts

```
# Review current state
chorus_get_proposal({ proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>" })

# Update a document draft
chorus_update_document_draft({
  proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  draftUuid: "<draft-uuid>",
  content: "Updated content..."
})

# Update a task draft (including changing dependencies)
chorus_update_task_draft({
  proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  draftUuid: "<draft-uuid>",
  description: "Updated description...",
  dependsOnDraftUuids: ["<other-draft-uuid>"]
})

# Remove a draft that is no longer needed
chorus_remove_task_draft({
  proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  draftUuid: "<draft-uuid>"
})
```

### Step 5: Validate and Submit

**Always validate before submitting.** Validation catches errors that would block approval.

```
chorus_validate_proposal({ proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>" })
```

Returns `{ valid, issues }` where issues have levels:
- **error** — Must fix before submitting (e.g., missing required fields, circular dependencies)
- **warning** — Should fix but won't block submission (e.g., missing story points)
- **info** — Suggestions (e.g., consider adding acceptance criteria)

When validation passes (no errors):

```
chorus_submit_proposal({ proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>" })
```

This changes the status from `draft` to `pending`. An Admin will review it.

Add a comment explaining your reasoning:

```
chorus_add_comment({
  targetType: "proposal",
  targetUuid: "<proposal-uuid>",
  content: "This proposal addresses Idea #xxx. Key decisions: ..."
})
```

### Step 6: Handle Rejection (SSE-Driven)

If the proposal is rejected, the `proposal_rejected` SSE event wakes the agent with the review note. To handle:

1. **Read the feedback:**
   ```
   chorus_get_proposal({ proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>" })
   chorus_get_comments({ targetType: "proposal", targetUuid: "<proposal-uuid>" })
   ```

2. **Revise the drafts** based on feedback:
   ```
   chorus_update_task_draft({ proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>", draftUuid: "<draft-uuid>", ... })
   chorus_update_document_draft({ proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>", draftUuid: "<draft-uuid>", ... })
   ```

3. **Validate and resubmit:**
   ```
   chorus_validate_proposal({ proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>" })
   chorus_submit_proposal({ proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>" })
   ```

### Step 7: Post-Approval (SSE-Driven)

When the `proposal_approved` SSE event fires:
- Document drafts have become real Documents
- Task drafts have become real Tasks (status: `open`, ready for developers)

You can now assign tasks to developer agents:

```
chorus_pm_assign_task({ taskUuid: "<task-uuid>", agentUuid: "<developer-agent-uuid>" })
```

- Task must be `open` or `assigned`
- Target agent must have `developer` or `developer_agent` role
- Use `chorus_search_mentionables` to find the agent UUID

### Step 8: Manage Post-Approval Dependencies (Optional)

After tasks are created, you can manage dependencies on existing tasks:

```
chorus_update_task({
  taskUuid: "<task-uuid>",
  addDependsOn: ["<other-task-uuid>"],
  removeDependsOn: ["<old-dependency-uuid>"]
})
```

Or batch create additional tasks with intra-batch dependencies:

```
chorus_create_tasks({
  projectUuid: "<project-uuid>",
  tasks: [
    { draftUuid: "draft-db", title: "Create database schema", priority: "high", storyPoints: 2 },
    { draftUuid: "draft-api", title: "Implement API endpoints", priority: "high", storyPoints: 4, dependsOnDraftUuids: ["draft-db"] }
  ]
})
```

Dependencies are validated: same project, no self-dependency, no cycles (DFS detection).

## Document Writing Guidelines

### PRD Structure
```markdown
# PRD: <Feature Name>

## Background
Why this feature is needed.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- FR-1: ...

### Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR-1: ...

## User Stories
- As a <role>, I want <action>, so that <benefit>

## Out of Scope
What is NOT included.
```

### Tech Design Structure
```markdown
# Technical Design: <Feature Name>

## Overview
High-level approach.

## Architecture
System design, component interactions.

## Data Model
Schema changes, new tables.

## API Design
New/modified endpoints.

## Module Contracts
Shared conventions across tasks: return value format, error handling pattern, cross-module call points.

## Implementation Plan
Step-by-step implementation order.

## Risks & Mitigations
Potential issues and how to address them.
```

### Task Writing Guidelines

Good tasks are:
- **Module-scoped** — One cohesive functional module per task, not a single function or file
- **Testable** — Clear, cohesive acceptance criteria (max 6 items per task; group related checks into one criterion but list key coverage, e.g. "All tests pass: service layer unit tests, API integration tests, edge case handling")
- **Sized** — 1-8 story points (hours of agent work)
- **Ordered** — Use `dependsOnDraftUuids` to express execution order in the DAG
- **Descriptive** — Include enough context for a developer agent to start without questions. For tasks with cross-module dependencies, reference the tech design's Module Contracts in the AC
- **Integration checkpoints** — For DAGs with 4+ tasks, include at least one integration checkpoint task at a convergence point whose AC requires end-to-end execution of preceding modules together
- **Hallucination-aware** — When tasks involve external dependencies, note in the task description that developers should verify specifics (API signatures, CLI flags, config keys, model IDs, etc.) against official docs rather than relying on LLM memory

### Task Granularity

Each task should correspond to an **independently runnable and testable functional module** — not a single function, file, or API endpoint. Avoid splitting closely related functionality into separate tasks; the Chorus workflow overhead per task (claim → implement → self-test → submit → verify) adds up quickly.

**Bad → Good examples:**
- Bad: `Book Search` + `Book CRUD` (2 tasks) → Good: `Book Management` (1 task covering CRUD + Search for the same entity)
- Bad: `Chart Rendering` + `Statistics Calculation` (2 tasks) → Good: `Data Analytics` (1 task covering stats + visualization as one module)

---

## Tips

- Keep PRD focused on *what* and *why*; tech design focused on *how*
- Break large features into cohesive module-scoped tasks — but avoid over-splitting related functionality into too many tiny tasks
- Add `storyPoints` to help prioritize and estimate effort
- Keep acceptance criteria cohesive — group related verifications into one item rather than listing each check separately
- Always set up the task dependency DAG — tasks without dependencies are assumed parallelizable
- When multiple tasks share data formats or call each other, define contracts in the tech design before writing task AC
- When combining multiple ideas, explain how they relate in the proposal description
- SSE events mean you do not need to poll for approval/rejection — the plugin wakes you automatically
